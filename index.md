## Currently

Based in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany. My specialities are Probability, Software Verification and Machine Learning. I am currently building AI generated training data for autonomous vehicles. 

## Education

`2018-2023`
__Oxford University, DPhil Computer Science.__

My [thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b77662da-2fed-4e1b-8a9f-58612f29c692) concerned Hidden Markov Models. These models are probabalistic state based transition systems that emit a partially observable trace and aim to model the semi-random execution of computer programs. My PhD was about the comparison of two such models. In particular, when one can prove that two models behave probalistically indentically and when, despite all randomness, one can tell them apart.

`2014-2018`
__Oxford University, Masters in Mathematics and Computer Science.__

## Occupation

`10.2022 - now`
__understand.ai__
Karlsruhe, Germany    
_Machine Learning Engineer_  
We make automatically generated training data for autonomous vehicles. In particular, I was on the team that built an object detection model using combined camera and LIDAR data.

`July 2017 - September 2017`
__Grakn Labs Ltd__
London, UK  
_R&D Specialist_  
This summer internship was for a startup that makes next generation graphical database technology. My focus was on implementing novel algorithms for extrapolating probabilistic relationships between entries in the database.

`July 2013 - October 2014`
__Somo Global__
London, UK  
_Data Scientist_
I primarily worked with PHP, Java and Hadoop. My main task was writing Apache Pig queries to efficiently process the billions of records of data the company had collected into a form that was human understandable and useful for business decisions.
