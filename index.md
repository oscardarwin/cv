# Oscar Darwin

Probability Specialist, Software Engineer

__E-Mail:__ [oscar.henry.darwin@gmail.com](mailto:eralp@eralpkaraduman.com)  
__LinkedIn:__ [linkedin.com/in/oscar-darwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-darwin-44189076/)

Based in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. My specialities are Probability, Software Verification and Machine Learning. I am currently building AI-generated training data for autonomous vehicles. 

## Education

`2018-2023` __PhD Computer Science__, Oxford University

My [thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b77662da-2fed-4e1b-8a9f-58612f29c692) concerned Hidden Markov Models in the context of the execution of computer programs. My research focused on the comparison of two such models. I developed two algorithms. The first can decide whether two random programs have identical execution patterns. The second can decide whether two programs are distinguishable, given enough observations. Finally, I discovered how many observations the optimum distinguishing procedure takes.

`2014-2018` __Masters in Mathematics and Computer Science__, Oxford University

## Occupation

`10.2022 - now` __Machine Learning Engineer__, understand.ai, Karlsruhe, Germany    

I was on the team that built an 3D object detection model using combined camera and LIDAR data. Moreover, I was heavily involved in designing a new pricing model for the product in order to create the right incentives inside our company and also with our partner companies. I worked primarily with python including numpy, bigquery sql, pytorch and tensorflow and nix.

`July 2017 - September 2017` __R&D Specialist__, Grakn Labs Ltd., London, UK  
  
This summer internship was for a startup that makes next generation graphical database technology. My focus was on implementing novel algorithms for extrapolating probabilistic relationships between entries in the database.

`July 2013 - October 2014` __Data Scientist__, Somo Global, London, UK

I primarily worked with PHP, Java and Hadoop. My main task was writing Apache Pig queries to efficiently process the billions of records of data the company had collected into a form that was human understandable and useful for business decisions.
