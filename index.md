<img src="docs/assets/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" width="400"/> | Based in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany. My specialities are Probability, Software Verification and Machine Learning. I am currently building AI generated training data for autonomous vehicles.

## Education

`2018-2023` __PhD Computer Science__, Oxford University

My [thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b77662da-2fed-4e1b-8a9f-58612f29c692) concerned Hidden Markov Models. These models are probabalistic state based transition systems that emit a partially observable trace and aim to model the semi-random execution of computer programs. My PhD was about the comparison of two such models. In particular, when one can prove that two models behave probalistically indentically and when, despite all randomness, one can tell them apart.

`2014-2018` __Masters in Mathematics and Computer Science__, Oxford University

## Occupation

`10.2022 - now` __Machine Learning Engineer__, understand.ai, Karlsruhe, Germany    

We make AI generated training data for autonomous vehicles. In particular, I was on the team that built an object detection model using combined camera and LIDAR data.

`July 2017 - September 2017` __R&D Specialist__, Grakn Labs Ltd., London, UK  
  
This summer internship was for a startup that makes next generation graphical database technology. My focus was on implementing novel algorithms for extrapolating probabilistic relationships between entries in the database.

`July 2013 - October 2014` __Data Scientist__, Somo Global, London, UK

I primarily worked with PHP, Java and Hadoop. My main task was writing Apache Pig queries to efficiently process the billions of records of data the company had collected into a form that was human understandable and useful for business decisions.
